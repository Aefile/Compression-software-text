Compression of text files using HUFFMAN TREE  
输入一个文本文件名，统计该文件中各字符频率。首先对各字符进行Huffman编码，将该文件翻译成Huffman编码文件B；然后将Huffman编码文件译码成文件C，并对原文件与文件C进行比较。  
Enter a text file name and count the frequency of each character in the file. Firstly, each character is Huffman coded, and the file is translated into Huffman coded file B. Then the Huffman coded file is decoded into file C, and the original file is compared with file C.
